First public commit
I tested this feature and it works well, thanks for the update 👍
Is there any plan to add more examples in the documentation?
I faced a small issue during setup — any workaround available?
Great improvement compared to the previous version.
Can you clarify how this function handles edge cases?
I think adding a quick start guide would help beginners.
